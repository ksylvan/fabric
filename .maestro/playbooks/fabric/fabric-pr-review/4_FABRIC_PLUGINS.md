# Document 4: Fabric Plugin Architecture Review

## Context

- **Playbook**: Fabric PR Review
- **Agent**: Fabric-PR-Review
- **Project**: /Users/kayvan/src/fabric
- **Date**: 2026-04-06
- **Working Folder**: /Users/kayvan/src/fabric/.maestro/playbooks

## Purpose

Verify that new or modified AI providers and plugins follow Fabric's plugin architecture.

## Prerequisites

- `/Users/kayvan/src/fabric/.maestro/playbooks/REVIEW_SCOPE.md` exists from Document 1

## Tasks

### Task 1: Load Context

- [x] **Read scope**: Load `/Users/kayvan/src/fabric/.maestro/playbooks/REVIEW_SCOPE.md` to identify plugin changes.
  Scope loaded on 2026-04-05; it currently reports no files changed under `internal/plugins/` and marks plugin architecture review as not needed.

- [x] **Check if plugins changed**: If no files in `internal/plugins/` were modified, skip to Task 7 and note "No plugin changes in this PR."
  - Confirmed via `REVIEW_SCOPE.md` and `git diff --name-only upstream/main...HEAD -- internal/plugins` that this PR does not modify `internal/plugins/`.
  - Skipping Tasks 2 through 7 and proceeding directly to documentation with the note: "No plugin changes in this PR."

### Task 2: Review VendorPlugin Interface

For new or modified AI providers in `internal/plugins/ai/`:

- [x] **Check interface compliance**: Verify implementation of `VendorPlugin` interface from `internal/plugins/plugin.go`:
  - `Name() string` - Returns vendor identifier
  - `Models() ([]string, error)` - Lists available models
  - `Chat(context.Context, *ChatRequest) (*ChatResponse, error)` - Main chat method
  - Any other required interface methods

- [x] **Verify registration**: Check that the vendor is registered in `internal/core/plugin_registry.go`:
  - Vendor name is unique
  - Proper initialization
  - Model aliases configured (if applicable)

Skipped Task 2 because no files under `internal/plugins/ai/` changed in this PR.

### Task 3: Review OpenAI-Compatible Vendors

For vendors extending `openai_compatible`:

- [x] **Check base extension**:
  - Properly embeds `openai_compatible` base
  - Only overrides necessary methods
  - API endpoint is correctly configured

- [x] **Verify API differences**:
  - Any provider-specific headers
  - Authentication method (API key, OAuth, etc.)
  - Model name mapping if different

Skipped Task 3 because no OpenAI-compatible vendor plugins changed in this PR.

### Task 4: Review Streaming Implementation

- [x] **Check streaming support**:
  - Implements streaming via callbacks
  - Handles SSE (Server-Sent Events) correctly
  - Properly closes connections on context cancellation
  - Error handling during streams

- [x] **Verify stream cleanup**:
  - No goroutine leaks
  - Buffers are flushed
  - Resources are released

Skipped Task 4 because no plugin streaming implementations changed in this PR.

### Task 5: Review Model-Specific Features

- [x] **Check feature flags**:
  - Thinking/reasoning modes (if supported)
  - Web search capabilities
  - Image/multimodal support
  - TTS (text-to-speech) support

- [x] **Verify context handling**:
  - Context window limits respected
  - Token counting (if applicable)
  - Truncation strategy for long inputs

Skipped Task 5 because no model plugin feature code changed in this PR.

### Task 6: Review Configuration

- [x] **Check config loading**:
  - API keys from environment variables
  - Proper use of `godotenv`
  - No hardcoded credentials
  - Fallback handling for missing config

- [x] **Verify flag support**:
  - CLI flags for provider selection
  - Model selection flags
  - Provider-specific options

Skipped Task 6 because no plugin configuration or provider selection code changed in this PR.

### Task 7: Review Other Plugin Types

For changes to other plugin types:

- [x] **Database plugins** (`internal/plugins/db/`):
  - Proper connection handling
  - Query safety (no SQL injection)
  - Resource cleanup

- [x] **Strategy plugins** (`internal/plugins/strategy/`):
  - Proper prompt modification
  - Strategy chaining support
  - Error handling

- [x] **Template plugins** (`internal/plugins/template/`):
  - Extension loading
  - Variable substitution
  - Security of template execution

Skipped Task 7 because no files under `internal/plugins/` changed in this PR.

### Task 8: Document Plugin Issues

- [x] **Create PLUGIN_ISSUES.md**: Write findings to `/Users/kayvan/src/fabric/.maestro/playbooks/PLUGIN_ISSUES.md`:

```markdown
# Plugin Architecture Review

## Plugins Reviewed
